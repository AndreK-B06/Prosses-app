- I'm making a Prose app that can control water into the tank and water out.but also drain the tank if necessary. 

- The tank must have a function that shows how much water is in itand show the amount in percentage.

- valves must be able to be pressed to close or open. but alos an auto function, if there is too much water in the tank
